# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Pre-flight health check

Before invoking ANY task matching the trigger criteria in the `preflight-health-check` skill, the lead agent MUST run that skill first. Treat its output as a gate:

- 🟢 **GO** — proceed silently (one-line confirmation only).
- 🟡 **FIX-AND-GO** — proceed, mention auto-fixes in final summary.
- 🔴 **BLOCK** — do not start the user's task. Report the blocker and ask the user how to proceed.

Trigger criteria (run preflight first):
- Task spawns 1+ subagents
- Task involves `next build`, `pnpm install`, `docker compose build`, or full-app `tsc --noEmit`
- Task references "Phase X", "Batch X", or "remodel"
- Task writes to multiple component files
- Task runs full test suites
- Task follows the `qa-clinician-remodel` skill

Skip preflight for: single-file reads, single-file edits (<50 lines), read-only queries, git status/log/diff inspection, and already-running QA reports.

Never bypass preflight on a major task. Never prompt the user "run preflight?" — just run it. Output is silent on GO, surfaced fully on FIX-AND-GO or BLOCK. Reports are always written to `docs/preflight-reports/preflight-<UTC-timestamp>.md` for the audit trail.

## Production verification — standing law

**A real doctor's visit is never a smoke target.** Not to take a screenshot, not
to confirm a deploy, not "just this once". Signing, adopting into, or exporting
someone's actual clinical note to prove your own change works is not a test —
it is editing a medical record for your convenience.

Production verification is **structural**:

- container health, image digests, applied migrations
- the flag is inlined in the shipped bundle (grep the built chunk — a
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` read that survives at runtime means it was NOT inlined)
- co-tenant HTTP status
- DOM *presence* of the new surface on a route, without mutating anything
- full flows ONLY on the synthetic smoke-doctor account, cleaned to baseline
  afterwards, with the audit rows left in place

The **full clinical walk lives on QA**, against a build that is byte-identical
to the one promoted — same commit, same build args, separately tagged image.
QA is the isolated `meddoc-qa` stack (`127.0.0.1:9020`, synthetic DB, MOCK_AI).
It is localhost-only by design; reach it through an SSH tunnel. Never rebuild
prod's `:latest` to stage something — tag a separate image and point a compose
override at it.

If a flow genuinely cannot be exercised on QA, say so in the report and leave it
unverified. An unverified step named honestly is worth more than a green tick
bought with a patient's record.
